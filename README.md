### Hi there friend ðŸ‘‹

## About me

I'm a person on planet earth who currently works at nowhere. In my ~~spare~~ time I make some cool software for Linux. 

Take a look around and please enjoy your stay.

## More facts

 - Python is my favorite programming language. I also know a bit of C/C++, just a little bit. 
 - Fun fact, I first learnt programming making games with Flash/Actionscript, but that was a long time ago now.
 - My daily driver OS's are Arch Linux + GNOME and macOS.
 - I like adventure games and indie music.
