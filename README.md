### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Taiko2k, the andorid sent to you from Cyberlife! Nice to meet you!

I'm a bit of a nerd (INTP) whos excited about technology and culture. As you could probably tell by me having a Github, one of my main hobbies is Programming. Check out some of the cool software I've made down below. Its mainly for Linux as thats what I use almost soley as my home desktop OS.

Python is my main programming language. But I also have some experience in Javascript and C++. Actually the first programming language I ever learnt was Actionscript. (That should give you an idea of how old I am :satisfied:)

I also like games :video_game:, music :musical_score:, aesthetics :city_sunrise: and anime :dango:. (You could probably already tell those too)

If you wanna conact me, see my email in the side bar, or add me on Discord: `Musou#5761`. I'm happy to meet new friends, though I should warn you, I'm not a super social person.
